## Michael Fusco
### Husband, Father, Veteran and grateful man

This blog serves as a landing page for my thoughts, hopes, wishes, dreams, desires, and most importantly my professional development.

<br>

In this blog you will find personal details and encounters as well as the means by which I commit to changing who I am to become the best me I can be.
In addition to personality statements, I document my personal but professional endeavors from noob to a fluent full stack developer. I pursue programming language, framework, development, blockchain, cryptocurrency, finance, institution, remote work... and more. Come join me in my pursuits all for the better and in the name of love and our God.
