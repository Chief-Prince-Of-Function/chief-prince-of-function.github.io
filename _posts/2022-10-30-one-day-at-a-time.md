# one day at a time

<br>

Song: AA, Walker Hayes

<br>

I skipped a few days… It happens from time to time. Truth be told however, my original goal was to do 7 days in a row. Id like to call myself a ```doer``` but sometimes I find a way to procrastinate, delay, or just plain skip it. But with this blog it isn’t about anything other than writing when I want and not writing when I don’t want. Grammar aside, pressure or discomfort are not part of why I write.

<br>

Today I am back and feeling inspired. The past few days have been chaotic a bit (positive) and have left me little time to personally digest life in the way that leaves me ready to write it down. Sometimes it can take me a day or two to process my life in its totality and kind of “update my status” if you will. When I do complete my brain rewiring I can actually find the articulation within me to jot down or post about my thoughts. It is very important to my life to take things ```one day at a time```.

<br>

As the title suggests, I do suffer from alcoholism in me. After 4.5 years sober now I also find myself safe to assume that I won’t be back at it again. Much like other problems in life though, it can be insidious and you must be aware of it every day… if needed. The title does suggest many many other articulations as well, ill leave those interpretations up to the reader.

This week at Syracuse I completed my lengthy but fun classwork with a day to spare. Hence my writing now instead of homework. Learning Javascript, HTML, server architectures, database design and framework, all leave me so excited for the future ahead of me in this CP endeavor. That is a nice improvement from 4th grade spelling class, where I was not allowed at recess due to my homework needing to be done at some point. Taking thinks one day at a time has lead me to this new path or brain rewire where my excitement for the lesson and gained knowledge vastly outweighs the burdens of struggling with the work. This excitement can be applied across the vast universe time and time over. But that would be redundant now wouldn’t it… (Quantum fans agree)

<br>

Lets remember that not every word in every blog post is about you. Some may be intended for a future or wide audience. Just as life, lets take things ```one day at a time```, and be patient with ourselves as well as others as we all work to find our happiness. Take time to consider your thoughts today. Take a minute to gather your thoughts into what actually makes sense and is right. Discernment is key, but I am willing to bet that you all already have it...
