# opportunity

At the crux of opportunity is perception. It is almost insane to say, but perception almost always guides opportunity. Have you ever looked back at something at found that you "missed the opportunity"? Now look back at that same missed opportunity with the focus being on your ideas/thoughts/opinions that steered you away from said opportunity. At this point you can see that given the missed opportunities future success, your ideas/thoughts/opinions at the time werent wrong, but more miss-guided. <br>

If at the time of decision we have a better understanding or better grasp or better personal situation that would suit the opportunity. Sometimes however, we are not granted any of those and must make the best decision we can in the moment. The point is not to dwell on the past and "regert" it, but to learn from missed opportunities and hone our personality to suit the next opportunity better. It is this attitude/perception that leads to actual success. <br>

I start school again tomorrow and am excited for both the opportunity and success associated. At this point I am so eager to learn the incoming information that the success comes with every word that is passed to my ears. Again I am grateful for all I have. <br>

Look to the future, but let the lessons of the past gaze your eyes on the prize. <br>
