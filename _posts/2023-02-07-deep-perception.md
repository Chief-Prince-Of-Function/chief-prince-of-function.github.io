# deep perception

<br>

Song: Broken Halos, Chris Stapleton

<br>

Been a while. Lets break some ice with some deep thought. I have spent a great deal of time between November of 2022 and now in February of 2023 considering current events and historical context for the same. Thinking through the complexities of the universe and the lessons learned during research is a great passion of mine. I have put great stake in the afterlife and the personal acceptance of the greater power above. I have found that of the most important parts of existence here is to prepare for what is next. With current affairs mimicing "religious tribalism" I find myself considering 5 points that I consider factual.

<br>

1. Individuality supercedes all group actions. (if it doesnt work for every individual, it is not good enough for the group)
2. Every form of religion falls short of OUR higher power's significance. (if you mentally damn others, you have fallen short)
3. Hell can be temporary. (at that end, we all should aspire to shorten our time necessary)
4. Purposeful perception will train your brain over time. (growth mindset, open mind, goal driven... practice to see from an all encompasing perception for a greater purpose)
5. When all is revealed, will you be ready to welcome your current enemy in with you? (if not... consider how our higher power may resolve the issue, im thinking that God would want both children home.

<br>

Be kind and work to brighten days, dont become a black cloud to others. If you find yourself there, remember that we ALL have our own broken halos and folded wings, humble nature is to follow.
