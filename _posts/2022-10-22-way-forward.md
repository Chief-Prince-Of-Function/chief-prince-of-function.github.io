# way forward

  There was a time, that negative emotions even from others would spin me up for days on end. That reaction no longer suits me. Today I am at work again, back to work on my mental acuity as well as my professional development.

  About 10 months ago I started a new company/business. @bosunshirts is a NFT and shirt company among other micro nuances. One of Bosun Shirts' micro services is a growing discord community and following through social media outlets. Among the greatest achievements to date and for the forseeable future is the recent addition of a partner. A second owner cost 50% of profit but it is my hope that this particular business partner will increase revenue and profit beyond the 50% reduction on my end. Super excited for the future of @bosunshirts.

  In two days time I will begin my 4th micro semester at Syracuse University. As a developer I have had three potential customers and since starting my freelance developer work I have at a minimum ironed out some wrinkles in the process that surely boost both performance and marketability. I developed an excellent "software development proposal" that can easily be edited in the future for other work and shared for your use if interested. However, in this sememster I am learning Javascript and database management. These two classes should serve well to achieve my ultimate goal of becoming a fluent "full stack developer". I have refocused my energy beyond the development of intuitive and robust applications for practice to patience in the process of achievement. Thank you for your support.

The way forward is one where past experience can only assist. The shedding of armour from the past, allows our full potential to shine through and guide our path to success. Food for thought.
