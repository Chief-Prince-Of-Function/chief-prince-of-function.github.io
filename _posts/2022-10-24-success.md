What an interesting point... Current noun state of success is listed as "the accomplishment", yet the archaic version stated both "the good or bad outcome".

<br>

The pursuit of happiness or the pursuit of success are often grouped together. In the USA we have an unalienable right to the pursuit of happiness but we ```do not``` have the unalienable right to success (it ain't written in the DOI). At that end, we each own our own success. But what does success mean?

<br>

To me success is both the accomplishment of or the bad outcome of an undertaking, aim, or purpose. New definition aside, I like the version that takes all points of both present and past noun definitions and combines them to gain the full and robust version of the word. It is this version that both accurately and un-biasly portrays the word success. The oddity involved with the current/present definition is that there is no version of success where you have failed. Funny part is with the archaic version it does incorporate. I find that the failures are not defining of a lack of success. Do not let it get twisted, in your failures you too are successful. Success is based on the outcome, not the mission. The thing is, even when we fail we gain. I have heard a few versions of a nice little phrase in my life that pertains to this topic. "the price of the lesson" is the most basic version but others have obviously taken it a step farther and incorporated wit to make fun versions such as "stupid tax". 

<br>

Heres the deal... the skinny version... the TLDR version.

<br>

```DO NOT``` let the lack of finance/praise/notoriety deter you from your goals. Look back on the times that you did not get the outcome of desire and learn from them. There is no situation in your life that you cannot gather knowledge from. Read your life like a book and find the areas where success was hidden and the accomplished outcome was found down the road. Then apply that to today.

<br>

What can you focus on today to garner more success in your life tomorrow?
It is this montra/parable/mentality that guides me in my future success. I am eager and excited to see what the future holds, but I work hard to not try to rush it. That is probably a topic for another post...
