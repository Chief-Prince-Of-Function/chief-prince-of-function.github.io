# 'Cuse

Today is the start of my semester at Syracuse University. <br>
Project management is something I have both a history and passion for. During my 14 years in the military I was certainly the manager of numerous projects. <br>

Military life does differ from the 'civilian' sector in many ways. So project management is assumed to differ as well. <br>

I look forward to the gained knowledge, perspective, and new found skills associated. These methods should serve me well in my goals to develop and deploy a few apps including the Bosun Shirts app, and the Veterans Go Outdoors app. I cant wait to organize the projects with the industry standard of practices. I hope it makes for effective and more seamless success. <br>

I have recently looked into app development frameworks and given open source options as well as the most cost effective or free bases, I have sent a few emails that deserve a response and have added information to my local repos. <br>
