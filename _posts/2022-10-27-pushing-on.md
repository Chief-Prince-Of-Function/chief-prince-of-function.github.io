# pushing on

<br>

Song: Paul Revere, Beastie Boys

<br>

In the military there are these things called ```guiding principles``` that serve as quick 3-4 phrases from the command as to how to act on the daily basis in the service. These principles are developed through introsepective thought and portrayed as a means to ensuring compliance with orders from above.

<br>

Upon higher achievement in the service, I was brought to a place where I too had to develop a set of ```guiding principles```. Strive for more, Honor those you serve, and Care for people were my three chosen phrases. The act of ```pushing on``` can come from and mean many things. Apply it where you see fit, the important thing is to always work to keep moving forward.

<br>

Sometimes life hits us from up close and directly where it counts. It is important to keep our eyes on the prize and push on to the goals we have before us.

<br>

In programming news: Front end development frameworks like Javascript coupled with backend development work within databases will certaintly serve well throughout my developer career. With becoming a ```full stack developer``` as my next professional goal at hand, these programming frameworks and the knowledge gained while reading these extensive texts are effectively pushing me on. Further down my path laid before me.
