Song: The Git Up, Blanco Brown

<br>

As the world turns round and round, we can easily get caught up in the throes of life. Sometime these throes seem more like hammers, yet the world and life continue. I am grateful for the process laid before me and my ability to learn and grow throughout the entirety. Let’s not forget how short life really is though. We all are aware of how quickly it can all end, and the ultimate finality that we all face. The best bit of advice I can give is to dance. Dance like nobody is watching and dance to the rhythm of your heart and soul. Moments taken to enjoy and release from the pressures are healthy and FUN...

<br>

You don’t have to particularly dance, you can do whatever makes your heart happy. Some sing, some play instrument, some speak comedy, actors / actress, etc... Really any activity that puts you out there can be done. The next step to putting yourself out there is to not worry about who’s watching or maybe judging. Forget about it all and focus on the movement or action at hand. To wallow in worry and self-scrutiny provides no positive outcome. What once served us as a protection mechanism in adolescence is now crippling us from portraying our true self’s. Be free to be free. I make dance videos from time to time. Even post them on YouTube and Facebook for my friends to see and smile while watching. I’m not a bad dancer (I practiced a lot as a child and have decent rhythm) and I’m not afraid to look silly or whimsical myself to lift another person’s day. Some will judge for sure, some will critique as well, some will be jealous, but some will smile or laugh. To brighten another’s day is a passion of mine. I have spent countless days in my journey through CPTSD and TBI wallowing in my grief and pain. I have prayed that my pain can serve as relief for others or lesson learned for me and hope to be a shed of bright light to those who see.

<br>

When you put yourself out there, relieve yourself of worries, accept the positive feedback and release any possible negative... you will find how shallow judgement is, and how much you have just risen above it. I hope this process turns you from judging and brings positivity to your life through new understanding.
