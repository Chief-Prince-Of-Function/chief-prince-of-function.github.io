Song: all the above, maino (feat. T-pain)

<br>

When life begins there is hope… ok, let's be real, all of life there is hope. Follow me for a second here though. At the beginning of our lives there is hope and inspiration for the dream to be realized. Your family of origin either brought you into this world intentionally or un-intentionally (I am sorry to hear that and I see you if that is you). The hope and inspiration comes from your eyes however. Come into this world and find awe and amazement in your perception. Over time this clouds but imagine back when you were knee high.

<br>

Early phases of life are dually of impact in natural trauma and importance. Now again, let's clear up the word use of “trauma”. Not all trauma is bad trauma. I have been overwhelmed with traumatic emotion of absolute positive nature. When the Buffalo Bills won the divisional championship game in 2021, I was in the stands. Nearing the end of game, the Buffalo defense intercepted the ball in dramatic fashion near the end zone, I was overwhelmed with traumatic emotion. Vivid, trauma, impactful… not all of it must be bad. The point is that as we progress through this life we find ourselves overwhelmed with experiences of both positive and negative nature. The odd part is that most of our differences aren’t of the positive nature. The most impactful differences seem to be of negative origin. The trials and tribulations define us mentally when we focus on the needs of the world and its ambitions over the process laid in front of us. We can find every difference between us and even exploit it just as many many have before. But what if we all understood collectively that our individual hardship qualifiers should never serve as weapons. I tell people often, the difference is not in bigotry or racism It is factually in whether you are or are not an asshole (please excuse). Let that sink in...

<br>

Some of us carry heavy burdens of negative nature. Some of us, many of us id even argue are of the current and typical understanding of trauma as that of the PTSD variety. I won’t go into my mental struggles with CPTSD but I will say that many of us are together in this battle but don't even know we are fighting it together.

<br>

I am remembering to focus on the nature of ```all the above``` where both all of us are included and all of our struggles are shared. This is the natural and absolute way of life where even our most passing interactions could have secondary or even tertiary effects that might even exceed the stimulus trauma. If I stub my toe in the morning and yell at my “annoying” child before school, by the end of the day when we meet again things may have spiraled individually from the morning experience to a point where my younger me is feeling the same negative trauma that I did and prayed I would not repeat. You get the point… Just please find a way to be kind. Today if none other before or after. Say something nice and know, you all are loved. I promise it.

<br>

```all the above``` could have its own series in my head. My brain operates with ```all the above``` at its core. I can’t fully explain yet, but with practice in eloquence and interpretive language, I hope to find a way…
