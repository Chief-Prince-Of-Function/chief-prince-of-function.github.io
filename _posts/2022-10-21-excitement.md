# Excitement

  It has been a long time since I have been truly excited about my future. From birth on up to about 19.5 years old I was stricken with worry that life was both going to be cut short and or will never succeed to be worthy. It was this fear and worry that wound up guiding me through life. Over time, it came to provide security and measure to accomplish based on avoidance of the fears that I placed along my timeline. <br>
  
  But now It has been shed. I have been through both intensive inpatient and now fairly intensive outpatient therapy with weekly meetings. From childhood trauma to military combat trauma my life was confusing, but now I have set a few personal boundaries. This time instead of setting up ```trip wires``` along my path to fear/worry/avoid, I have set up two distinct boundaries/walls to not cross. <br>
  
  Both boundaries deal with conflict resolution. The first is my newest wall of prevention. I will not cross lines in conflict resolution that I know will end in hostility or aggression. Self explanatory to most but to me its a 36 year process that I need to be clear about. I am in no danger, and due to my size, I most often am not in danger. Therefore I do not require to approach situations with aggression or hostility. Furthermore I can avoid the two all together by merely paying attention to that boundary before any situation even arises. For the second boundary is secure but should be avoided all together. <br>
  
  As a second measure or personal wall of protection. Through tried and true troubles, I have successfully avoided laying hands on others. Upon a time, that was difficult to do. The past 10 years I have carried that fear/worry/avoidance but again it is time to shed that. With boundary 1 firmly in place, trust in myself, and firm belief/trust in my god, I will not lay hands on others violently anymore. Feels good but odd just to type that... <br>
  
That is all for now. But more to come. <br>
