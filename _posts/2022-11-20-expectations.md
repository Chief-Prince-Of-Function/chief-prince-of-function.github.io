# expectations

<br>

Today I took a break. While my children were cleaning the bathroom that they and their friends destroyed during this weekend's festivities... I took a break and went to shower myself. En route to my shower I had to re-explain how to utilize the drain hair removal wand. My daughter was afraid to get her hand dirty in the mess. Quick fix with dad's little advice to "get it done", lol. When I was in my bedroom preparing for the shower I was praying as I do when cleansing myself. In prayer I found myself considering my expectations of God. I thought about times where I expected a breakthrough in an upcoming or present moment.

<br>

Almost as if these moments were like opening a door. I bought a new car, I hope for new happiness. I find a $10 bill in the laundry, I hope for new financial prowess... you get the parable but when I was considering God in mind, I found myself hoping for wisdom from God in moments of strife in my life. I have become self trusting in discernment from organic thought to organic  thought with God's given desires in mind... Insanely difficult topics to describe aside, I find the consideration of my ```expectations``` for God, self, nature, and others at times to cloud my ability to just live in peace and comfort. It took me a minute to understand while in my shower preparation prayer but they say writing helps. Here I am learning that I do not have to have the answers to every question or situation.

<br>

Some ```expectations``` can be set and sustained when incorporated into self. I now ```expect``` myself to handle situations and circumstances as they come with TRUST in my process as well as TRUST in myself to do so with good purpose in mind. I ```expect``` God, nature, and others to respect me just as I respect them in common interaction. I do not require or expect a pre-primed solution that will inevitably fail. Just as it has failed me so many times in the past.

<br>

I hope my own vulnerabilities can serve others for good in their life. I pray that others can benefit from my life just as every reader has benefited mine. Thank you.
