# Progress over perfection...

I have a history of overextending my passion in an attempt to rush success. <br>
This method once served me well in my professional pursuits. The attitude of 'strive for more' was at the forefront in my endeavors. This lead me down a road of great mystery and wonder. This new found method of passion came with great amounts of personal feedback. My commitment to success in my early 20s coupled with the endless opportunities within the United States military, I became heavily decorated and very respected among my peers. <br>

But then in my late 20s I came to realize the secondary damage of this selfish behavior. I later became sober and further understood more and more of the various facets of my life that have contributed to both my successes and my failures. It is this understanding that now guides me to further understand and so on... <br>

At this juncture I am with sound social, economic, financial, family, and personal status and thus am beyond excited to continue on with this life and maybe wise passion at this point? <br>

Today: I remember and forgive at the same time. I press forward at a steady but surefire pace that is best aligned with my life. This commitment does not slow down progress but does bring it back to a manageable level. Progress over perfection. <br>
