Song: let her go, passenger

<br>

Today I was saddened. I sold my beloved ```2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Black Bear edition```. I bid her farewell and adoo to another fellow that was a real pleasure to meet. I have had this Jeep listed for sale for over a months time and have had the various versions of random people interactions through the process, as one could expect. I decreased my price a bit, then a bit more over a few weeks time. Today I sold it well below even that number. Cash in hand wins at the end of the day and I could certaintly use it. This young man was incredibly grateful and his young hard ball tactics coupled with his love for my veteran stories made him very pleasing to interact with. It made my decision simple. this Jeep has been all over the East Coast with me from taking hundreds of Veterans fishing, me fishing, golfing, daycare trips, high school trips, first family camping trip, a trip to buy a camper and back empty handed, and even the kids first time with the roof off... Ole Jeep is about that adventure life and is ready for its next one.

She was built for adventure and she will enjoy what this young man has planned for her. If only she could hear the excitement and stoic boist of this guys voice over his new toy to cherish and take him to and from his self employed painters gig. If she could hear it... ```and you let her go``` 

<br>

she would have innevitably be remissed of the surprise. Much like my day started with my dream car in my driveway and ended with the excitement of what is to come. She will have to wait to see what is in store for her. My memories of my children helping me remove those doors and beyond still remain in my mind and heart. I cannot hold value on false idol. I must focus on the truth and secure my financial future.

<br>

Perserverance is important. Jeep lives on and so do I. My kids wont ever forget those moments either and we will also make many many more. Perserverance is such where I now am excited for a new whip. Im going the beater route while finance builds, but this vehicle may end up in my daughters hands next year when she hops behind the wheel for the first time, and after I have carefully built her 'ol reliable...

<br>

Dont be sad about the past. Be grateful that you had the chance to love something like that. Thank you all for listening.
