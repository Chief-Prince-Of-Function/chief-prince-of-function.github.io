The commitment to pursuit of effective code with decentralism (new term I learned while reading about Ethereum Classic (ETC)) at the forefront comes with great letdown and a long road ahead. <br>

I do not let the discouraging nature of the work distract me from the goal of truly decentralized finance and services for all. <br>

I am American, but the "America first" moniker reigns with the truth of decreasing other national resources for the benefit of our own.
That isn't the spirit of America and thus, I will create or assist in the creation of another option with decentralism at the forefront. <br>

Fiat and America are fine, both thrive under the tech driven new option. Be careful as to steward traditional measures into new measures. Lets not pigeon hole ourselves or our thoughts to believe that one must fail for the other to survive. <br>
Today: I focus on passion and re-engagement of equilibrium based methods that will hold me solid as I progress with intent and patience through this endeavor. <br>
