# scars heal

<br>

Sometimes we set out with best laid intentions and end up falling flat on our faces. Most often these falls get met with our best efforts to correct or fix. Most often again these efforts to correct end up putting us back on our planned path with minimal persistent effect. Other Times, with some people the most often end state is factual failure.

<br>

Not to say that any of us are failures or that our intentions even actually become failures. But in the literal and definitive sense, failure or the "omission of expected action" is exactly what happens for some. I happen to have a 36 year past that is riddled with failures. These falls from grace once set me back to the point where I was most apt to just plain quit the attempt out of frustration. Now isn't that a failure! One where you intentionally fail out of frustration. I'm sure at least some of you know what that feels like.

<br>

Today I am at more peace with my past. Today I am able to fail freely. When I fail (just as I did last night), I am more able than ever to process, grieve, plan, and succeed in repair. I still have setbacks and falls just as before but the important part is to recover from the inevitable despite your primal or primitive nature to quit or not push on. Yesterday I failed to finish all of my required weekly homework. I missed the deadline on one of my 10 weekly assignments. To plainly state it though, I am still in the fight and not giving up. This small mess up spun me up this morning with guilt, shame, and remorse (a few of my favorites). I pondered, contemplated and ultimately reached out to a trusted source. My mother is a previous adult learner at the Bachelors level, she was very capable and ready to offer the needed advice. I reached out for some words of advice and got exactly what I needed, a loving smother to tell me that it was ok and I am not off track. I don't need a 4.0 nor is that expected of me ```relief```. I then set a plan to finish the work late and submit for deducted but sufficient credit. Lesson learned and knowledge/skill gained. Thank you mom, always appreciative of your lessons of experience.

<br>

It happens. Between the workload of life, take time to find the silver lining and remember that ```scars heal``` best with time and sound self care only.
