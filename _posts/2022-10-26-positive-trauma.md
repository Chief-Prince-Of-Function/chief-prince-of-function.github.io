“Have I the courage to change today?”

<br>

As with most of my thoughts, my last post may have confused, disrupted, or even upset others. Lets host a little session of positivity. Of course there will be deep thinking if you’d desire, but please feel free to focus freely with positivity if desired. 

<br>

Ever feel like a pawn in the game? Ever feel like we all are too focused on the same detrimental vices? Ever wonder if we Will ever get out of this mess?  Some say no, others say yes, and some say we already are out of the mess.. I think they all are correct but for brevity today lets stick to positive trauma…

<br>

Like I said in my last post, trauma is not always negative. Sometimes positive trauma can become addictive due a myriad of reasons but always in addition to the endorphin interaction inside our brains. It cannot be avoided and those exact increases in normality often are what we are chasing within our subconscious. But positive experiences aren’t always ending in addiction. Positive experience such as catching a missile running trout on light tackle, bring me to such a great place. That no matter what I read or write, I don't find difficulty in my own comfort level. Some of those memories live as a crutch to my passive comfort… don’t dwell on that… just a pun.

<br>

Sometimes my life can spiral out of my mental control though. The totality inside my head is of the entire universe (vulnerability alert). I have been told this is rare and unique. Those words make me feel more alone and wrong than most others. But the truth is, even those words become completely positive when considering my innate desire to help. If I did not feel alone in this discomfort of universal totality while operating in a circumstantial world… then what would be the point of it all for me? Essentially I would not have it any other way if given the choice. I was the kid who took recess as my opportunity to assault my and other peoples bullies. I then became a bully to protect the bullied, as a bullied but capable person. What a mess and not the correct way to handle yourself I shall add. But when I learned to focus on positivity my universe became much more at peace and my body's response is always of calming nature. What a relief from the years of distress within...

<br>

Brevity aside, in my best moments I am living within my positive perceptions of my experiences through this life. If I focus on the negative aspects, I will exude negativity. When I focus on thinking positively, and on finding the positive outcomes of negative experiences, I in turn exude positivity. Becoming a shining light on others existence is of upmost importance to me.

<br>

I think it is for you as well…
