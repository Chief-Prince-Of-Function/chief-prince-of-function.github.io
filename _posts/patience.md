Song: Redemption Song, Bob Marley & The Wailers

From the dawn of organized civilization there has been rift. Today we deal with the existential threat of polarization that has seeped from politics into our society. From the brink of WWIII to COVID to raising interest rates yet again... beyond the huge issues that are mostly unavoidable from our seats, we face interpersonal strife related to vaccines, external affairs (Ukraine), religion, migration, and even aliens (totally real). Is it truly any different though? Let’s throw the Middle Ages out the window because who is trying to digest all that... aside from those wild 1,000 years (476-1450) what era can you find where strife and divide weren’t present. I beg it difficult to produce. The point of this illustration is not to point out the flaws of society at hand but to bring light to the possibility that the true answer beyond "it all" could be Love and maybe a bit of humble mixed in with gratitude...

Looking at, or focusing on the polar topics of modern society has mostly proven to be feeble and infantile in my endeavors. When living life focused on issues of mine and the worlds I found myself an angry, discruntled, and toxic person. For the past 6 or so years I have avoided polar topics and news / media with upmost effort. This small lifestyle change came with a change in perception. After the growing pains of avoidance, there is great growth personally from a point of letting go of the seemingly important topics and then grasping to newfound importance such as self-growth, self-help, mindfulness, interpersonal skills, work ethic... the list goes on but all in positive spirit and light. Focus on what builds you and us up. Let go of what weighs us down. Live for now and let go of what is life taking vs life giving. These changes wont be easy at first but we all have them to make...

<br>

Patience in the process can be difficult. But with practiced patience you can achieve a new look or lease on life and truly live for what you are meant.
